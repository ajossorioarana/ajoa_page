***Note**: This is my first article. I'm not in mood of making a "welcome, the blog is open" type of post, so instead I've decided to discuss some other topic that is interesting me.*

### Intro

If you'd been to my [about][ref1] page, it'll come to no surprise to you that I work at a company that specializes on lake management servicies. 

This is **not** an easy task. 

To manage effectively a water body one has to understand:
+ the morphology of the lake
+ the soil and climate of the region
+ the posibility of connection with groundwater
+ inflows and outflows of water and their quality
+ phytoplankton and zooplankton communities
+ fish population

And many more.

This applies to almost all freshwater bodies, natural or artificial. Those are characteristics that define the patterns of energy and nutrients within a lake, and the relationship with the different organisms present in that ecosystem. 

Nevertheless, I've encountered another factor that plays a critical role in a succesful lake management scheme: **communication**, or the lack of a proper one.

> "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place"[^1]

Our main clients consist on homeowners associations, apartment communities, golf courses and private landowners. As such, we often deal with a **community** or someone that speaks for the community.
