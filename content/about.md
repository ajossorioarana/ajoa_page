Main areas of interest consists in **hydrology**, **ecohydrology**, **limnology**, **irrigation**, **watershed management** and **data science**.

Used to play guitar and do vocals at an argentine traditional folk group, [**Los Pulperos**][SPOTIFY]. We are not active anymore, but still perform from time to time.

Consider reading by a fireplace with a glass of whisky as a sanity preserver (Although beer or wine could do the trick)

Love going to the countryside or lake, sharing an *asado* and *guitarreada* with friends and family..
